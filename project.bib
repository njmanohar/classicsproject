	Abstract = {We show how to find sufficiently small integer solutions to a polynomial in a single variable modulo N, and to a polynomial in two variables over the integers. The methods sometimes extend to more variables. As applications: RSA encryption with exponent 3 is vulnerable if the opponent knows two-thirds of the message, or if two messages agree over eight-ninths of their length; and we can find the factors of N=PQ if we are given the high order                                                                             {\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}} {\backslash}log{\_}2 N{\$}                   bits of P.},

@article{Lenstra,
	Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the description and analysis of a new algorithm to factor positive integers. It depends on the use of elliptic curves. The new method is obtained from Pollard's (p-1)-method (Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 76 (1974), 521-528) by replacing the multiplicative group by the group of points on a random elliptic curve. It is conjectured that the algorithm determines a non-trivial divisor of a composite number n in expected time at most K(p)(log n)2, where p is the least prime dividing n and K is a function for which log $K(x) = \sqrt{(2 + o (1))log x log log x}$ for x → ∞. In the worst case, when n is the product of two primes of the same order of magnitude, this is $exp((1 + o(1))\sqrt{log n log log n})$ (for n → ∞). There are several other factoring algorithms of which the conjectural expected running time is given by the latter formula. However, these algorithms have a running time that is basically independent of the size of the prime factors of n, whereas the new elliptic curve method is substantially faster for small p.},
